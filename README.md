# dotnet-webapi
REPO STATUS: complete

A very simple web api built with asp .net core.

This is a simple todo api for a todo list (note- stored in memory rather than an actual database).
There are endpoints that cover the CRUD acronym; simple, nothing fancy.

Check out the tutorial that I followed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api).
